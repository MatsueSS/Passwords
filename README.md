PasswordsManager

I would like to introduce my own pet project, which I decided to write in a fit of inspiration while studying C++. The technologies of this language interested me incredibly. As a task for myself, I decided to write my own password handler. This idea inspired me because there is nothing like this for me.
This project presents password encryption using the Caesar method, the implementation of reading and writing data from and to a file.
It seemed strange to me to implement the project without using Cmake, because I believe that assembling a project and breaking it down into a readable, expandable and convenient structure is the priority of any project.
I am going to use this project now, because it is convenient and performs the main function - it makes my life easier.
In the future, I will probably use this project as a library, for my next projects.
